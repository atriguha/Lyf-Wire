   ->Total number of pending appointments .
   ->Total number of new patients.
   ->Total number of operations.
   ->Total Income  of the hospital.
   ->Graphs related to administrative data of the hospital
  The page is made user friendly and interactive with the help of graphs.
  It offers a separate page for the list of appointments for a Doctor, clicking on any one of them will take us to their individual medical profile.
##Patient's Interface:
   The landing page of  Patient's portal will reveal the basic health information of the patient, like:
    -> Chart to show progress of the patients health, like improvement in pelvic tilt,for the case of the prototype we are building for arthritis patients.
    -> Oxygen Level indicator
